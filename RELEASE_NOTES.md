## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
4.4. Most of these features are described more fully in the user manual.

- Allows for multiple presets to be defined and applied automatically
  on matching images. Each preset after the first one will create a
  new module instance just on top of the current module (so it applies
  after).

  To better view which module instance corresponds to which preset the
  module label is set to the preset name. This preset name will be
  changed if some parameters on the module are changed (and so does
  not correspong to the preset anymore). If the module label is hand
  edited it will be kept.

## Other Changes

- Do not invalidate snapshot anymore when the history is changed
  (compressed or reset). All snapshot are now stored with their full
  history and can be reconstruct properly.

## Bug Fixes

## Lua

### A action support for Lua

- The lua call to dt.gui.action has become more flexible, with most
  parameters optional, so you can read the focused status of a module
  doing just dt.gui.action("iop/filmicrgb", "focus").

- tooltips show these compacter lua commands in mapping mode (only
  adding the last parameter, instance, if the module supports
  multi-instance) and have been added to presets and styles menus as
  well.

- Lua commands can be copied to the clipboard, using ctrl+v in the
  shortcuts dialog, both from a selected action or shortcut, or long
  right click when in mapping mode (over a widget) or in the
  presets/styles menus.

- The shown/copied lua command for a slider or combobox will set the
  value it currently has.

- A bug with shortcuts (and dt.gui.action) to set the active item in a
  combobox with varying content has been fixed and now it is also
  possible to directly set the values of the combos for the focused
  module's blending mode etc. (by setting the shortcuts effect).

- Added section headers to the sort by drop-down (files, times, etc).

- Shortcuts assigned to presets or styles will be shown when hovering
  over them in their menu.

- Long left clicking a preset will keep the menu open so you can
  quickly switch between several to see the effect without having to
  repeatedly click the preset button to reopen the menu. You can also
  scroll over the preset button to switch to previous/next presets
  (like you already could via shortcuts).

- A shortcut can now be directed to a lua script that mimics a
  standard slider, dropdown or button, but dynamically selects the
  real widget(s) that receive(s) it, based on for example which module
  is focused or enabled. The advantage is that all fallbacks work as
  normal, so you can assign a midi knob to it and turning it (holding
  shift/ctrl to speed up/down) or pressing it to reset work regardless
  of which widget receives it. Basically this is a much more flexible
  alternative to the fake widgets under processing
  modules/<focused>. This allows owners of for example an x-touch mini
  to use their scarce rotors in different, fully configurable, ways
  while working in different modules (which can also be focused using
  midi buttons which will then light up). Such configurations could be
  shared using https://github.com/darktable-org/lua-scripts.

- Support shortcuts to sliders/combos created in lua, either via
  visual mapping mode or in the shortcuts dialog under the lua
  category. Elements and effects are not supported.

## Notes

- With the support of JXL, AVIF and EXR for export, selecting specific
  metadata (eg. geo tag, creator) is not currently possible. For
  formats JXL, AVIF and EXR, darktable will not include the metadata
  fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the export
  preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be supported by reverting the following change:
  remove line 241 of darktable.css file on your system. See:
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166
