## Notes

- With the support of JXL, AVIF and EXR for export, selecting specific
  metadata (eg. geo tag, creator) is not currently possible. For
  formats JXL, AVIF and EXR, darktable will not include the metadata
  fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the export
  preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be supported by reverting the following change:
  remove line 241 of darktable.css file on your system. See:
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166
