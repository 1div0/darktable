## The Big Ones

## New Features And Changes

- Rework the lighttable thumbs by using downscale preview while
  waiting for the final thumbs to be refreshed. This makes the
  lighttable feeling more fluid.

- Allow for removing an entry using <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> on
  the module groups. It was already possible to add a module,
  it is now also possible to remove one.

- New preferences to display the uncategorized entry in the
  collect module's tag view.

## Bug fixes

- Check if an AVIF encoder is available otherwise we just disable
  the AVIF format in export module.

- Fix a refresh issue on Windows in the retouch module. Switching
  on/off the scale preview was not always refreshing the display.

- Fix undo of color labels and rating in darkroom's film strip.

- Fix base curve preset matching. The match for the model was not
  strict enough and could select an invalid entry in the database.
